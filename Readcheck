1. CompanyHouse, Dunn & Bradstreet and Orbis company data are used using their API's.
2. 2 Gen AI agents are used wherein one agent is used for adverse media screening while the other agent is for transaction summary report for a company. 
3. The solution is displayed using streamlit and AWS is used as a platform.
4. The whole solution will utilise AWS as platform.
5. The development of the project, code and also its deployment and pipelining of the data using AWS.
